 ![Alt text](/./Screen%20Shot%202022-08-02%20at%2012.05.13%20AM.png)

This week's challenge we were tasked to create a quiz that could track our highscores and store our initials
We needed to complete this by coiding our html, css and javascript files
It also needed to include a timer
With each incorrect answer subtracting further from our initial 60 seconds
At the end of the game we needed to be presented with a text box for our initials
Which is how our highscores were tracked.
